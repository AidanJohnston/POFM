/**TODO: Remove this comment before submission
 *
 * For Gabe:
 *
 * The purpose of the move header is to given an input, deleted a file.
 *
 * This should be very close to copy.h, only the original file is removed
 *
* Things this program should do:
 *  1. Confirm the input file is valid, ie. exists.
 *      If file doesn't exists print error and then exit
 *
 *      If file exists continue with operation
 *
 *  3. If verbose flag is raised, explain what is happening
